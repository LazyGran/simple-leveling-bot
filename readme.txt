Hello and thank you for using my code! It may not be the best, but it gets the job done.


First setup:
Enter your bot token in the token.json 
-https://www.getdroidtips.com/discord-bot-token/ 
    That isnt my website, has some flaws. You dont need to discribe your bot in a minimun of 400 words for example, you dont have to describe him at all
Add your bot to your server
Open this folder in the Windows command prompt
Type in "node ."
There you go, you should now see a "started" message getting output, your bot is online and ready to use! Be aware that the bot only is online as long as that window is open! 
If you want to host the bot on a server, please just use google to find out.


What you can and cant do with that code:
You can do everything with it except for saying that you made it. Use it for every of you projects, would be nice if you credit me then, but no need to.

Additional information:
Dont worry about the "data.json" not being there even when you first start the bot, it will create one by itself once needed!
